    <h2>1920</h2>
    <h3>Robot Beginnings</h3>
    <p>
        Czech author Karel Capek coined the term <i>robot</i>, the first instance of which was in his play <b><i>Rossum's Universal Robots</i>.</b>

    <h3>Codes of Conduct</h3>
    <p>
        Isaav Asimov devises the three laws of robotics <a class="ref" href="https://www.auburn.edu/~vestmon/robotics.html">[2]</a>:
        <ol>
            <li>
                "A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm."
            </li>
            <li>
                "A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law."
            </li>
            <li>

    <h2>1948</h2>
    <h3>Robots, Upgraded</h3>
    <p>
        Neuropsychologist and roboticist William Grey Walter constructed and debuted some of the very <a class="ref" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Grey_Walter#Robots">first autonomous robots</a>, named Elmer and Elsie; Walter aimed to demonstrate how sophisticated behaviours can be encoded by just a few connected brain cells.

    <h2>1950</h2>
    <h3>Turing's Test</h3>
    <p>
        Alan Turing, one of the pioneers of computer science, developed a procedure to gauge a machine's intelligence. His concept, called The Imitation Game (now better known as the Turing Test), was proposed in his paper <b><i>Computing Machinery and Intelligence</i></b>. In the Turing test, a human evaluator is made to have a natural language text-based conversation between another human and a computer that is designed to respond like a human. The evaluator is aware that one of their conversation partners is a computer, but is not explicitly told which one. The computer passes the Turing test if the evaluator cannot confidently discern (with over 50% accuracy) between the human and the computer conversation partner. While considered not the most definitive way of measuring machine intelligence, the Turing test was still one of the pioneering ideas that helped create conversation around intelligent systems and machines that can "think."

    <h2>1951</h2>
    <h3>Snarky Systems</h3>
    <p>
        Marvin Minsky built the first neural network, called the Stochastic Neural Analog Reinforcement Calculator (SNARC), which is regarded as one of the principal developments in the field of intelligent systems.

    <h2>1956</h2>
    <h3>The Birth of AI</h3>
    <p>
        It wasn't until 1956 at the Dartmouth Conference, lead by John McCarthy and Marvin Minsky, that artificial intelligence, both the term and the field, was officially introduced and established.
    </p>
    <h3>Here is a section of the project proposal <a class="ref" href="https://www.livinginternet.com/i/ii_ai.htm":>[3]</a></h3>
    <blockquote>
        We propose that a 2 month, 10 man study of artificial intelligence be carried out during the summer of 1956 at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire.

        The study is to proceed on the basis of the conjecture that <strong>every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it</strong>. An attempt will be made to find how to make machines use language, form abstractions and concepts, solve kinds of problems now reserved for humans, and improve themselves.

    <h2>1997</h2>
    <h3>Checkmate</h3>
    <p>
        The Deep Blue supercomputer, developed by IBM, defeated renowned chess champion Garry Kasparov. Although Deep Blue depended mainly on brute force techniques, the win was seen as one of the groundbreaking moments that put AI in the spotlight.

    <h3>A Driving Force</h3>
    <p>
        Google debuts its self-driving car project, now called Waymo, which was headed by Sebastian Thrun. The project aims <a class="ref" href="https://waymo.com/tech/"/>[5]</a> to make fully autonomous cars that help increase road safety and to make getting around simpler and more seamless. Currently, Waymo uses deep learning technology to "teach" cars how to steer clear of obstacles as well as to anticipate the actions of other motorists and pedestrians on the road in order to avoid accidents.

    <h3>Who Is Watson?</h3>
    <p>
        IBM's Watson system, which was conceived in 2006, competed in American game show Jeopardy! and beat two former winners of the show, Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings. IBM has opened up the Watson platform to businesses and corporations so that its artifical intelligence technology can be used throughout various industries, including medical, science, and even culinary. Currently, Watson is being used by a slew of companies in a slew of industries: for example, Wimbledon utilises Watson to automatically create video reels of tennis matches.

    <h3>Hey, Siri</h3>
    <p>
        Apple unveils Siri, which was one of the very first mobile virtual assistants that brought together areas of intelligent systems, like natural language processing and speech recognition with machine learning, and rolled it all in one package. Over the years, Apple has honed Siri, making the technology faster more accurate, as well as letting third-parties integrate with the assistant. Siri helped usher in a new era of digital assistants, with Google releasing Google Now and, subsequently Google Assistant, Amazon's Echo, and Microsoft's Cortana.
    </p>
    <h3>Google's Brain</h3>
    <p>
        Around the same time, Google was also helping jump-start the adoption of speech-recognition by incorporating it into a number of its core products, including Search. Google started its Google Brain project, which focuses on researching numerous techniques for machine learning, including image recognition, data analysis and voice recognition, and making their findings available to Google services such as Search, Maps, and Android.

    <p>
        The AlphaGo system created by DeepMind (which Google acquired in 2014 <a class="ref" href="https://deepmind.com/about/">[6]</a>) beats Go world champion Lee Sedol in a breakthrough event for artificially intelligent systems. The game of Go is deemed one of the most, if not the most complex board games especially for a computer system to crack. AlphaGo uses a slew of artificial intelligence techniques like neural networks and deep learning. The system used a combination of supervised learning (in which it is given data to learn from) and reinforcement learning (in which the system plays against itself) to help it progress and eventually defeat Lee.
    </p>
    <h4>Interesting Fact</h4>
    <p>
        DeepMind Co-Founder and CEO Demis Hassabis garnered his PhD in Cognitive Neuroscience at the University College London <a class="ref" href="https://deepmind.com/about/">[7]</a>.

<div>
    <h2>2017</h2>
    <p>
        DeepMind recently published a paper on the journal Nature, detailing how its new system, AlphaGo Zero, was able to defeat the original AlphaGo 100 games to none. AlphaGo Zero is based solely on reinforcement learning techniques, essentially meaning that it learned the game entirely from scratch, without any data about human strategies or previous gameplays. This research was groundbreaking and helped cement the power of reinforcement learning.
