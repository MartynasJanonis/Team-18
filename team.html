        We are a group of five aspiring computer scientists who are passionate about technology and how it is shaping our world. Artificial intelligence is one of the most prominent and remarkable fields of research that is rapidly changing the way we think about modern computing. We wanted to be able to capture its full breadth and depth in this website.
