            <span class="drop-cap">A</span>rtificial Intelligence is at its peak hype right now. According to Lynsey Barber, who has been named Technology Journalist of the Year at the UK Tech Awards, “deep learning and machine learning are at what it calls the 'peak of inflated expectation', but are just two to five years away from mainstream adoption”<a href="references.html#introduction" class="ref" target="_blank">[1]</a>. If everything you hear about latest AI advancement leaves you slightly confused, do not worry - you are not alone. The term “artificial intelligence”, much like many other buzz words, has been adopted widely by marketers and advertising copyrighters. We have asked a few experts to help us actually define what intelligent systems are, and we got slightly different answers from everyone. This led us to believe that it is extremely important for people to start learning about the methods and prospects of intelligent systems and what it means for our future.
            <br>
            <br>
            Most of the researches we have communicated with and spoke tended to think that the latest advancements of AI are strictly connected to deepening our understanding of intelligence in general, more specifically human intelligence. Therefore, we define artificial intelligence with respect to its ability to replicate the way human beings think.

          <p>
            Alan Turing, one of the pioneers of computer science, developed a procedure to gauge a machine's intelligence. His concept, called The Imitation Game (now better known as the Turing Test), was proposed in his paper <i>Computing Machinery and Intelligence</i>. In the Turing test, a human evaluator is made to have a natural language text-based conversation between another human and a computer that is designed to respond like a human. The evaluator is aware that one of their conversation partners is a computer, but is not explicitly told which one. The computer passes the Turing test if the evaluator cannot confidently discern (with over 50% accuracy) between the human and the computer conversation partner. While considered not the most definitive way of measuring machine intelligence, the Turing test was still one of the pioneering ideas that helped create conversation around intelligent systems and machines that can "think."

            Google debuts its self-driving car project, now called Waymo, which was headed by Sebastian Thrun. The project aims<a href="references.html#history-ref-ref" class="ref" target="_blank">[4]</a> to make fully autonomous cars that help increase road safety and to make getting around simpler and more seamless. Currently, Waymo uses deep learning technology to "teach" cars how to steer clear of obstacles as well as to anticipate the actions of other motorists and pedestrians on the road in order to avoid accidents.

            Apple unveils Siri, which was one of the very first mobile virtual assistants that brought together areas of intelligent systems, like natural language processing and speech recognition with machine learning, and rolled it all in one package. Over the years, Apple has honed Siri, making the technology faster more accurate, as well as letting third-parties integrate with the assistant. Siri helped usher in a new era of digital assistants, with Google releasing Google Now and, subsequently Google Assistant, Amazon's Echo, and Microsoft's Cortana.

The game of Go is deemed one of the most, if not the most complex board games especially for a computer system to crack. AlphaGo uses a slew of artificial intelligence techniques like neural networks and deep learning. The system used a combination of supervised learning (in which it is given data to learn from) and reinforcement learning (in which the system plays against itself) to help it progress and eventually defeat Lee.

          <h5>AlphaGo Zero</h5>
          <p>
            DeepMind recently published a paper on the journal Nature, detailing how its new system, AlphaGo Zero, was able to defeat the original AlphaGo 100 games to none<a href="references.html#history-ref">[7]</a>. AlphaGo Zero is based solely on reinforcement learning techniques, essentially meaning that it learned the game entirely from scratch, without any data about human strategies or previous gameplays. This research was groundbreaking and helped cement the power of reinforcement learning.

            We sat down with UCL Senior Teaching Fellow Dr. Sunny Bains to ask her about some of her previous work in the artificial intelligence industry, back when many of the concepts and techniques that we take as commonplace today were only just coming into fruition.
            <br>
            <br>
            Dr. Bains had been interested in AI since she was a child. She fell in love with the science behind holograms and optics, which lead her to study physics. But she later discovered that many of the innovations behind optical computing, back in the late 80s, were related to machine intelligence.

            I've spoken in my lectures about understanding your competitors. In order to understand the competitors to these optical technologies, I needed to start to understand a little bit more about the non-optical technologies that were emerging at that time, and so that got me interested [in artificial intelligence].

            While AI might appear to be a predominantly digital phenomenon, Bains was more interested in the analogue side of it. In 1997, she wrote her PhD thesis on "Physical computation and embodied artificial intelligence," in which she focused on ways to compact the power of artificial intelligent systems into a "human-sized package."

          <p class="text-white">
            In 2016, researchers at UCL, led by Dr. Ingo Waldmann, unveiled the Robotic Exoplanet Recognition system (called RobERt), which uses machine learning to identify the chemical composition of the atmospheres of exoplanets. RobERt is built on a deep-belief nerual network<a href="references.html#publications-ref" class="ref" style="color:white;">[1]</a>, and learns by being given sample data of atmospheric compositions. Typically, it takes astronomers many days to anaylse one exoplanet's atmosphere, especially because of the immense volume of data being gathered. RobERt would significantly speed up this process and help make finding the next habitable planet much easier.

            Geoffrey Hinton is one of the principal researchers in artificial intelligence. His most notable work involved utilising backpropagation to train neural networks. Neural networks learn by comparing the output it produces to the desired correct output (specified by the human supervisor), and then adapting its "neural connections" accordingly. Such an example could be in attempting to recognise images of cats - if a neural network is shown an image of a cat, and it incorrectly states (outputs) that it is not a cat, this error will be used to update the connections in the network so that it can more accurately identify images of cats.

          <h5 class="text-white">Machine versus Machine</h5>
          <p class="text-white">
            A neural network is a system that is built to model the structure of the human brain and the networks of neurons that make up the nervous system. A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) consists of two neural networks that are made to compete against each other: a generator and a discriminator<a href="#" class="ref" style="color:white;">[3]</a>. The generator is given a set of randomised "noisy" input, and from it must produce a piece of data, such as an image of a dog. This data is subsequently passed into the discriminator, along with real data not created synthetically by the generator. The role of the discriminator is to determine whether or not the data it is receiving was produced by the generator. The goal of the generator is to develop data that is realistic enough to fool the discriminator, whilst the goal of the discriminator is to be smart enough to recognise the difference between the real and generated pieces of data. This back-and-forth feedback loop between the two networks is an effective method of training both networks.
            <br>
            The concept of GANs was conceived by researcher Ian Goodfellow and a number of partners. Their paper, published in 2014, can be found on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661)" style="color:white;">arXiv.org</a><a href="references.html#publications-ref" class="ref" style="color:white;">[4]</a>.
