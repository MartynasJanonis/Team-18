          <span class="drop-cap">A</span>rtificial Intelligence is at its peak hype right now. According to Lynsey Barber, who has been named a technology journalist of the year at the UK Tech Awards, “deep learning and machine learning are at what it calls the "peak of inflated expectation", but are just two to five years away from mainstream adoption”<a href="references.html#introduction" class="ref" target="_blank">[1]</a>. If everything you hear about latest AI advancement leaves you slightly confused - do not worry, you are not alone. The term “artificial intelligence”, much like many other terms, has been adopted widely by marketers and advertising copyrighters. We have asked a few experts to actually define an Intelligent system, and we got slightly different answers from everyone. That is why we believe it is extremely important that people start learning about the methods and prospects of intelligent systems.
          <br>
          <br>
          Most of the researches we have communicated with, tend to think that the latest advancements of AI is strictly connected to deepening in our understanding of intelligence in general, and specifically human intelligence. And therefore, we define artificial intelligence with respect to its ability to replicate the way human beings think.

        <h5>The Turing Test</h5>
        <p>
          Alan Turing, one of the pioneers of computer science, developed a procedure to gauge a machine's intelligence. His concept, called The Imitation Game (now better known as the Turing Test), was proposed in his paper <i>Computing Machinery and Intelligence</i>. In the Turing test, a human evaluator is made to have a natural language text-based conversation between another human and a computer that is designed to respond like a human. The evaluator is aware that one of their conversation partners is a computer, but is not explicitly told which one. The computer passes the Turing test if the evaluator cannot confidently discern (with over 50% accuracy) between the human and the computer conversation partner. While considered not the most definitive way of measuring machine intelligence, the Turing test was still one of the pioneering ideas that helped create conversation around intelligent systems and machines that can "think."

          Marvin Minsky built the first neural network, called the Stochastic Neural Analog Reinforcement Calculator (SNARC), which is regarded as one of the principal developments in the field of intelligent systems. The structure of a neural network tries to mimic that of the brain, using silicon "neurons" that receive and process information.

An attempt will be made to find how to make machines use language, form abstractions and concepts, solve kinds of problems now reserved for humans, and improve themselves.

The project aims<a href="references.html#history-ref-ref" class="ref" target="_blank">[4]</a> to make fully autonomous cars that help increase road safety and to make getting around simpler and more seamless. Currently, Waymo uses deep learning technology to "teach" cars how to steer clear of obstacles as well as to anticipate the actions of other motorists and pedestrians on the road in order to avoid accidents.

IBM has opened up the Watson platform to businesses and corporations so that its artifical intelligence technology can be used throughout various industries, including medical, science, and even culinary. Currently, Watson is being used by a slew of companies in a slew of industries: for example, Wimbledon utilises Watson to automatically create video reels of tennis matches<a href="references.html#history-ref" class="ref" target="_blank">[5]</a>.

Over the years, Apple has honed Siri, making the technology faster more accurate, as well as letting third-parties integrate with the assistant. Siri helped usher in a new era of digital assistants, with Google releasing Google Now and, subsequently Google Assistant, Amazon's Echo, and Microsoft's Cortana.

          The AlphaGo system created by DeepMind (which Google acquired in 2014<a href="references.html#history-ref" class="ref" target="_blank">[6]</a>) beats Go world champion Lee Sedol in a breakthrough event for artificially intelligent systems. The game of Go is deemed one of the most, if not the most complex board games especially for a computer system to crack. AlphaGo uses a slew of artificial intelligence techniques like neural networks and deep learning. The system used a combination of supervised learning (in which it is given data to learn from) and reinforcement learning (in which the system plays against itself) to help it progress and eventually defeat Lee.

AlphaGo Zero is based solely on reinforcement learning techniques, essentially meaning that it learned the game entirely from scratch, without any data about human strategies or previous gameplays. This research was groundbreaking and helped cement the power of reinforcement learning.
