AI is at its peak hype right now. According to Lynsey Barber, who has been named a technology journalist of the year at the UK Tech Awards, “deep learning and machine learning are at what it calls the "peak of inflated expectation", but are just two to five years away from mainstream adoption”. <a class="ref" href="#references">[1]</a>. If everything you hear about latest AI advancement leaves you slightly confused - do not worry, you are not alone. “Artificial intelligence”, much like many other terms has been adopted by marketers and advertising copyrighters. We have asked a few experts to actually define an Intelligent system, and we got slightly different answers from everyone. That is why we believe it is extremely important that people start learning about the methods and prospects of intelligent systems.

	<p>
Most of the researches we have communicated with, tend to think that the latest advancements of AI is strictly connected to deepening in our understanding of intelligence in general, and specifically human intelligence. And therefore, we define artificial intelligence with respect to its ability to replicate the way human beings think.
