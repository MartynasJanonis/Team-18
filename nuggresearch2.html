        <h1> Areas of Research</h1>

        <h2> Expert Systems </h2>
        <p> 
            Expert systems make use of Artificial Intelligence to become proficient in a particular domain and provide solutions like a human expert in that field would. 
            It is an intelligent computer program that makes use of a knowledge base which has facts and data collected from various credible sources and an inference engine which makes decisions and provides an answer.
             An expert system is a branch of artificial intelligence introduced by researchers in the Stanford Heuristic Programming Project.

        <h2> Natural Language Processing</h2>
        <p>  Ever thought how Siri or Cortana understand and react to your speech fairly accurately? These make use of very sophisticated Natural Language Processing techniques to give such a result. NLPs make use of Artificial Intelligence to understand and interpret human language. They are used in many fields and are extremely useful for visually impaired people.
            NLP is not an easy task in computer science or AI, contrasting to the human brain which can easily pick up and learn languages. This is because human speech is rarely consistent and is affected by various conditions such as emotions.

        <h2> Neural Networks</h2>
                <p> An Artificial Neural Network takes inspiration from the biological nervous system and the brain to carry out instructions and make decisions. 
                    The Artificial Neural Networkâ€™s structure is very similar to the human nervous system and it is composed of a large number of neurons which are highly interconnected particles.
                     These neurons work simultaneously to solve problems. They make use of machine learning to learn and improve by example just like humans.

        <h2> Robotics </h2>
            <p> Robotics is the most famous and widely implemented sub area of Artificial Intelligence. The applications of intelligent robotics are extremely vast such as in military, medicine and agriculture to name a few. 
                The main aim of robotics is to develop machines that can substitute humans to perform a given task. At this point researchers are nowhere close to making robots that can substitute a human brain completely through artificial intelligence but they are still able to make many tasks much easier to perform without human intervention.
