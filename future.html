      <h2>Self-driving cars</h2>
      <p>AI is set to rule the roads in the near future. With completely autonomous cars showing up as early as 2021, humans will soon have their own personal drivers available to them 24/7<a href="references.html#future-ref">[1]</a>.</p> <!-- https://futurism.com/a-global-leader-in-ai-promises-level-4-self-driving-cars-by-2021/ -->

      <h2>Unmanned aerial vehicles</h2>
      <p>From military drones to pilotless jetliners, AI will take complete control of the skies. All aircraft currently use some form of automation to ease the workload of the pilot. The next
      step is to make the aircraft completely autonomous.</p>
