    <h1>Dr. Sunny Bains: The Fruition of AI</h1>

    <p>
        We sat down with UCL Senior Teaching Fellow Dr. Sunny Bains to ask her about some of her previous work in the artificial intelligence industry, back when many of the concepts and techniques that we take as commonplace today were only just coming into fruition.
    </p>
    <p>
        Dr. Bains had been interested in AI since she was a child. She fell in love with the science behind holograms and optics, which lead her to study physics. But she later discovered that many of the innovations behind optical computing, back in the late 80s, were related to machine intelligence.
    </p>
    <q class="quote">I've spoken in my lectures about understanding your competitors. In order to understand the competitors to these optical technologies, I needed to start to understand a little bit more about the non-optical technologies that were emerging at that time, and so that got me interested [in artificial intelligence].</q>
    <p>
        While AI might appear to be a predominantly digital phenomenon, Bains was more interested in the analogue side of it.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 1997, she wrote her PhD thesis on "Physical computation and embodied artificial intelligence," in which she focused on ways to compact the power of artificial intelligent systems into a "human-sized package."
    </p>
    <q class="quote">The question to me was, how could you do stuff in real time in a machine that was either not connected or not that tightly connected to bigger networks; and literally trying to build brains - can you build something that could do what a human could do in that kind of space and with that kind of power?</q>
    <p>
        Currently, Bains is no longer in the Ai industry, after having moved on to other fields including philosophy and journalism. However, she still looks back fondly at her time in the field, and continues to follow AI closely.
    </p>
    <q class="quote">It was awesome, I've had an awesome life, I have no regrets.</q>
    <p>
        When asked what developments in AI she was most excited about, Bains described the brilliance of self-driving cars, most especially Google's work in the domain and Uber's traction in the industry.
    </p>
    <q class="quote">You probably don't remember life before Uber...That to me is amazing, and of course the next step are Google [self-driving] cars. I've lived in London, in Boston, near Seattle, in San Francisco, the Bay Area, and there's not one of those places that would not be a thousand times better if you got rid of most of the cars.</q>
