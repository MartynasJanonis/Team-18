        <h1> Areas of Research</h1>

        <h2> Expert Systems </h2>
        <p> Expert system is an artificial intelligence program that has expert-level knowledge about a particular domain and knows how to use its knowledge to respond properly. 
            Domain refers to the area within which the task is being performed. Ideally the expert systems should substitute a human expert. Edward Feigenbaum of Stanford University has defined expert system as “an intelligent computer program that uses knowledge and inference procedures to solve problems that are difficult enough to require significant human expertise for their solutions.” 
            It is a branch of artificial intelligence introduced by researchers in the Stanford Heuristic Programming Project. </p>

        <h2> Natural Language Processing</h2>
        <p> NLP is a way for computers to analyze, understand, and derive meaning from human language in a smart and useful way through Artificial Intelligence. By utilizing NLP, developers can organize and structure knowledge to perform tasks such as automatic summarization, translation, named entity recognition, relationship extraction, sentiment analysis, speech recognition, and topic segmentation.
                NLP is characterized as a hard problem in computer science. Human language is rarely precise, or plainly spoken. To understand human language is to understand not only the words, but the concepts and how they’re linked together to create meaning. Despite language being one of the easiest things for humans to learn, the ambiguity of language is what makes natural language processing a difficult problem for computers to master.

        <h2> Neural Networks</h2>
                <p> An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is an information processing paradigm that is inspired by the way biological nervous systems, such as the brain, process information. The key element of this paradigm is the novel structure of the information processing system. It is composed of a large number of highly interconnected processing elements (neurons) working in unison to solve specific problems. 
                    ANNs, like people, learn by example. An ANN is configured for a specific application, such as pattern recognition or data classification, through a learning process. Learning in biological systems involves adjustments to the synaptic connections that exist between the neurones. This is true of ANNs as well.

        <h2> Robotics </h2>
            <p> Robotics is the most famous and widely implemented sub area of Artificial Intelligence. The applications of intelligent robotics are extremely vast such as in military, medicine and agriculture to name a few. 
                The main aim of robotics is to develop machines that can substitute humans to perform a given task. At this point researchers are nowhere close to making robots that can substitute a human brain completely through artificial intelligence but they are still able to make many tasks much easier to perform without human intervention.
