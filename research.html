      </div>
      <p>
          We sat down with UCL Senior Teaching Fellow Dr. Sunny Bains to ask her about some of her previous work in the artificial intelligence industry, back when many of the concepts and techniques that we take as commonplace today were only just coming into fruition.
      </p>
      <p>
          Dr. Bains had been interested in AI since she was a child. She fell in love with the science behind holograms and optics, which lead her to study physics. But she later discovered that many of the innovations behind optical computing, back in the late 80s, were related to machine intelligence.
      </p>
      <q class="quote">I've spoken in my lectures about understanding your competitors. In order to understand the competitors to these optical technologies, I needed to start to understand a little bit more about the non-optical technologies that were emerging at that time, and so that got me interested [in artificial intelligence].</q>
      <p>
          While AI might appear to be a predominantly digital phenomenon, Bains was more interested in the analogue side of it.
      </p>
      <p>
          In 1997, she wrote her PhD thesis on "Physical computation and embodied artificial intelligence," in which she focused on ways to compact the power of artificial intelligent systems into a "human-sized package."
      </p>
      <q class="quote">The question to me was, how could you do stuff in real time in a machine that was either not connected or not that tightly connected to bigger networks; and literally trying to build brains - can you build something that could do what a human could do in that kind of space and with that kind of power?</q>
      <p>
          Currently, Bains is no longer in the Ai industry, after having moved on to other fields including philosophy and journalism. However, she still looks back fondly at her time in the field, and continues to follow AI closely.
      </p>
      <q class="quote">It was awesome, I've had an awesome life, I have no regrets.</q>
      <p>
          When asked what developments in AI she was most excited about, Bains described the brilliance of self-driving cars, most especially Google's work in the domain and Uber's traction in the industry.
      </p>
      <q class="quote">You probably don't remember life before Uber...That to me is amazing, and of course the next step are Google [self-driving] cars. I've lived in London, in Boston, near Seattle, in San Francisco, the Bay Area, and there's not one of those places that would not be a thousand times better if you got rid of most of the cars.</q>

    VR: To sort of go in a logical order, I’m probably going to as k you what got you interested in AI in
    the first place? </br></br>
    PB: I was thinking you were going to ask me about communication. So my father is an engineer
and from the age about 6 or 7, I was building robots and then A guy called Clive Sinclair, about 30
years ago, created a home computer boom, and he made something called Sinclair ZX Spectrum,
So I grew up with those as a kid. And for me it was exactly what I needed, I was building these
robots but they were very simple, and so I had a little brain and so I started messing around with
the computers and the electronics, writing software to make them run around. And that was my
childhood, I was a real geeky kid, I got interested in why biological systems seem to be able to do
stuff, and so I started writing software that mimicked evolution or the brain, and that’s what it did.
I did computing and electronics and maths, and things like that for A Levels, to do a degree an AI,
but in those days it was during an AI winter. So I did my first degree at the point where it was
really rock bottom. Only three universities in the UK that did AI courses. Most of them weren’t
even called AI, like in UCL, the reason it’s called Intelligent systems group, it’s because it was
created during the AI winter, and that’s why it’s not AI group. So anyway I had limited options, I
think it was Sussex, Essex, and Edinburgh that did AI degree. [...] I actually progressed to PhD
because I’ve always done these kind of things, so I did research, and then after the PhD my post
doc, 21 years ago was at UCL, and I’ve stayed even since. So these days I’m a professor, and I
had a research group for a very long time, although I’m now based in the AI company. So that is
my story. </br></br>

RM:
So you mentioned  the whole cycle of AI winters and... AI summers I guess? Would you say
this is an AI summer right now? </br></br>

PB:
Oh yeah, sure. All you have to do is to look at the movie industry. If there’s a lot movies on
that AI and robots, things are rosy for us. Absolutely without doubt, a glorious hot AI summer, very
sizzling hot, because, I think he last count there were 620 European start ups on AI. And that’s
just Europe, and across the world there’s hell of a lot more than that. So, it’s usually led by a
successor of a particular technique, and at the moment it’s deep learning, so everybody’s into
deep learning. And a lot of these companies claiming they doing AI - they don’t even know what it
is they using, they call it “Deep Something” because it sounds cool. But, it doesn’t matter, the
investors love it and there’s lot of investors, more than even investing in AI companies, so more
money floating about, and for some reason also it’s become very fashionable to be an
entrepreneur, and create your own company.</br></br>

PB:
Didn’t use to be. People used to want a secure job, but not anymore. People want to create
their own companies, they don’t realise just how awful it is
(laughs).
How low the percentage of
success is, but nevertheless, it’s crazy huge boom.</br></br>


RM:
So kind of relating to the whole ‘AI summer’ thing, how would you kind of differentiate
between the hype around AI, and what’s actually real? ... </br></br>


PB:
Okay, that’s a bit harder to answer. Because my perspective that I’ve print more than 20 years
doing research in this area. So for me it comes from experience, so what kind of depressing is
people are not half as original as they think they are, so over the years you kind of see the same
idea again and again. Like every time someone from the city comes and wants to do PhD with us
in AI, they say “Hey I’ve got a new idea - we’re going to use an AI technique to optimise training”.
Wow. I’ll be rich! You know, there must have been a number of times I’ve heard that, so we don’t
take that one. But again and again people do the same think, and even within the neural networks
research people repeat themselves. So yeah, I kind of hear a lot of the same stu
ff. So what impresses me is when I hear something that I haven’t heard before. But mostly what I hear is: “Oh
we’re a new company, we’re going to apply a technique which is probably five year out of date to
a problem that’s already been solved”. Wow. I am being cynical but you know, that doesn’t mean
they won’t be successful. Because there’s a big world out there and there’s a lot of scope for
companies to do the same thing. But true innovation and true originality are rare things.
</br></br>

PB:
 It’s hard to innovate, but we’re trying to do it. And my career has always been about trying to
understand how biological processes perform computations, because all of the main advances in
the AI have come from some kind of biological theory. So, neural nets, obviously from the brain,
but there are also things like genetic algorithms from evolution, particle swarm optimisation from
how swarms move, artificial immune algorithms from how the immune system works. So there’s a
lot of interesting techniques. And later versions of them may become formalised, but I think it’s
very important to look into biological processes and so our aim in this company is actually be a bit
destructive and create new technologies and new solutions.</br></br>
Also, part of my career is communications, so I’ve been a contributive editor for WIRED, I’ve
written several popular science books, and I’ve done many things on TV and radio. So part of I do
is to try and counter the bad messages because the problem with any AI summer is, you get a lot
of the ‘end-of-the-world’ people, except these days they have a thin veneer of credibility provided
by, some, well, the Oxford institute for future of humanity or something?
</br></br>
VR:
That exists?</br></br>
PB:
Yeah, there’s a professor called Nick Bostrom, who’s written books about the dangers of AI
and he’s not the only one, that only exists, only function in life is to write a bunch of reports, which
are usually highly negative reports, about what AI could do and how it could kill us all. It’s usually
the plot from the terminator movie that catches in and sewed on the scientific language and
they’re not researchers in the way that we are, we make stu
ff, and they researched they write stuff, lobbying UK parliament or even EU parliament. And their measure of success is how many
politicians they can influence. And frankly, we don’t have time to do this. We’re trying to work on
and make the technology and solve real problems, and so we have this realistic view that there’s a
negative influence in the society caused by these people. Sometimes I get out there, and try to
counter that message, but it’s very frustrating. There have been several things - like genetic
modifies crops. There have been certain types of research that if you’re not careful then the
funding will dry out and the research will grind to a halt. Because of these scaremongers. And I
find it very frustrating - I did a debate last week in European Parliament and I think they called it
“Is it rational to be optimistic about AI”. A debate like that, you would imagine, there’d be a panel
of experts on AI right? But I was the only computer scientist there! That was it. The other people
were philosophers or lobbyists. And people with no qualification to speak about this topic, except
that they’ve chosen to do so. And we getting new regulations pushed out in the Uk and in the EU,
so from next may we’ve got this regulation which all the EU states will be entitled to. Increasingly,
governments are seeing AI as some evil technology that you have to ban or keep under control,
which is complete nonsense. AI is a set of probably a thousand different techniques. Each one we
apply to a problem. AI has been around since the 1950s. You know, it’s embedded in technology
all around us, we just don’t call it AI. The original definition of AI which I prefer is making
computers do what they can’t currently do - as soon as the computer can do it, then we stop
calling it AI, this is just what computers do. So, it’s an old technology. There’s nothing to be
scared of. And if you got a safety critical system like a self-driving vehicle, the point of it is ti save
lives. Human drivers are actually not very safe. And for sure, it’s a safety critical system and if you
want to regulate it - do so. Don’t regulate the whole of AI. It’s like regulating the whole of
mathematics. Doesn’t make any sense. For instance for self driving cars - have new regulations,
new tests, new ways of measure how safe they are, a new driving test. But that’s quite different from putting the AI into a factory or a call centre.
</br></br>
RM:
So is that part of the reason why there’s such an outcry about AI? Because it kind of starting
to inject itself into everyday life. More people starting to depend on AI?
</br></br>
PB:
I think it’s partly entertainment - I mean all of the movies are always disaster stories about AI.
You know I enjoy it. They’re entertainment, but they’re not reality. It’s partly because of these
people who are popping out and every time there’s anything on the media about new AI advance,
they bring out one of these professor saying “Oh we’ve got to be so careful about these
technologies that are going to take away our humanity”, it’s garbage. So there have been a lot of
crap, not surprisingly the general public gets confused, there’s a lot of crap out there. As with all
of these areas, actually it’s the people - most engineers, most researchers who do the work,
they’re not communicators, they just do their work. They have quiet voices. The people with the
loud voices are usually the nutters. But it gives a very distorted view. In reality 99.999% of all
researchers say the same same thing - there’s no problem, just using AI to improve safety, we’re
doing very well. But because the media loves a debate they roll out, and then it looks like it’s
50/50. People thinking oh it’s such a balanced debate - it’s not a balanced debate. </br></br>
VR:
That is surprising to be fair, especially what you said about how sceptical governments are
towards the AI - there’s so much potential in it. </br></br>
PB:
Yeah, it’s improving. But you know, in this company we’re members of a parliamentary group
on AI. And one on the, what’s it called. Forgot the name of it, but it has to do with the next stage
of technology. And again what they do in parliament in here is they call evidence.</br></br>
VR:
Is that fourth industrial revolution group? </br></br>
PB:
Yes, that’s the one. I should try remember that. So that they can become informed they call
for evidence, they call experts in. Except that they call all kinds of random idiots. You don’t have
to print all this. They end up with, again a distorted picture. And the frustrating thing is - it’s really
fashionable right now. And you can get the CEOs from a hundred AI companies right now to
present evidence - a lot of them, all respects due them but they’re kids who’s got a couple of
years experience in this area, they don’t really know that much. If you really want evidence you
should get people who’ve worked in the area for decades, who know a little bit more, who’ve
seen how things go up and down and understand the unbelievable struggle to make the damn
thing work in the first place. This is the problem with it- we can barely make things work. It is so
hard, to make intelligent, smart software.
There’s so much hype, and it’s going to kill us. Exact same thing happened in the past. People
have made these predictions, people get bored, AI gets discredited, and we end up in AI winter.
It’s highly likely this is what’s going to happen, so I am enjoying the sunshine while we can. I
strongly suspect that give us another couple of years, and you will end up looking for a job
elsewhere. We will still do the same stuff. We just won’t call it AI, because the problems will be
there still. All the technology will still be there. </br></br>
